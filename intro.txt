TO THE CODERS:
--------------------

To start with DSA in C++, one must be familiar with "STL" , time & space complexity and ya ! basic syntax of writing code in C++ 

i.e. i/p and o/p , loops , function & function call (call by value and reference) , operators , switch case & if-else statements etc.
and these can be learnt in any language easily becoz these concepts remain more less same.

if you don't know C++ very well then don't stop yourself from learning DSA becoz you don't need to master any language before starting DSA.
you just need to be that much capable that you can write code with correct syntax.

I too never learnt C++ as such , i learnt C as my first programing language then learnt basic syntax of C++ and then found that rest all concepts are same as C only, hence i started DSA in C++


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

additional tip :)

have a good logic building habit before starting DSA , for that solve 15-20 standard pattern problems
